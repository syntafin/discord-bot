# A simple Discord bot

The only purpose of this bot so far is, to be online! 

Original written to make the bot online, that was created from [Hanashi](https://github.com/Hanashi)\'s Discord Plugin for Woltlab Suite Core

## Requirements

* NodeJS (^16.x)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:syntafin/discord-bot.git
```

2. Install NPM depedencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Get the Bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and insert it to ``token.json``

```json

   "token": "TOKENGOESHERE"
}
```

4. Run the script

Optional: use screenie or pm2 to let the bot run even if console is closed

I kept this bot simple, because initial he had nothing to do :) .
